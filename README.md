# Overview

Cunctator is a framework that enables [best-effort lazy evaluation for Python software built on APIs](https://2021.ecoop.org/details/ecoop-2021-ecoop-research-papers/17/Best-Effort-Lazy-Evaluation-for-Python-Software-Built-On-APIs). It tries to defer the evaluation of library APIs as long as possible, such that an optimizer can be applied to optimize a sequence of API calls before true evaluation.

What follows describes the Docker image of Cunctator, including instructions for running benchmarks and brief introduction of Cunctator's source code.
